## Installation & Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- UV package manager: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
- Running Cheat Engine with ce-mcp plugin enabled

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hedgehogform/ce-mcp-client.git
cd ce-mcp-client

# Install dependencies using UV
uv sync

# Activate the virtual environment
uv shell
```

## Usage

### As MCP Server

The primary use case is as an MCP server for AI assistants:

```bash
# Run as MCP server (communicates via stdin/stdout)
python -m src.cheat_engine_mcp_server
```

### Configuration

The client connects to the Cheat Engine REST API at:

- **Host**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
- **Port**: `6300` (default)
- **Timeout**: 600 seconds for long-running operations

### AI Assistant Integration

Add this MCP server to your AI assistant configuration to enable Cheat Engine functionality. The server provides tools for:

- **Memory Analysis**: Read/write memory values in various formats
- **Process Debugging**: Attach to processes and analyze their state
- **Pattern Scanning**: Find byte patterns and assembly instructions
- **Address Resolution**: Convert between symbolic names and addresses
- **Reverse Engineering**: Disassemble code and analyze program structure

### Example Use Cases

1. **Game Hacking**: Find and modify game values (health, money, etc.)
2. **Malware Analysis**: Examine suspicious processes and their memory
3. **Software Debugging**: Analyze program behavior and memory layout
4. **Security Research**: Test application security and find vulnerabilities
5. **Educational**: Learn about program internals and memory management

## Architecture

The client is organized into modular components:
